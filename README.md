# Sales Forecasting Project 
Created BY KISHAN CHAUHAN
## Project Overview

I worked on a real-world Sales Forecasting project where I analyzed historical retail sales data to derive insights and predict future sales trends using machine learning models.

## Key Responsibilities & Contributions

- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends, seasonality, and correlation between features
- Applied feature engineering techniques to enhance model accuracy
- Developed and evaluated predictive models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Used RMSE, MAPE, and R² Score to compare model performance
- Visualized actual vs. predicted sales and future forecasts using line plots and confidence intervals
- Identified top features affecting sales like promotions, holidays, and pricing
- Delivered strategic business recommendations for inventory, marketing, and pricing planning
- Created a complete project report, visual PPT, and clean Python codebase

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Details

This project focused on using historical retail sales data to build a machine learning model that can predict future sales trends. The goal was to provide actionable insights for inventory management, marketing strategies, and pricing decisions.

The project involved several key steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gathered historical sales data and cleaned it to handle missing values and outliers.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed the data to identify trends, seasonality, and correlations between different features such as promotions, holidays, and pricing.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features and transformed existing ones to improve model performance.

4. **Model Development**: Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Compared model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAPE, and R² Score.

6. **Visualization**: Created visualizations to compare actual vs. predicted sales and to show future sales forecasts with confidence intervals.

7. **Insight Generation**: Identified the top features affecting sales and provided strategic business recommendations.

8. **Documentation**: Prepared a comprehensive project report, a visual PPT, and maintained a clean Python codebase.

The project successfully demonstrated how machine learning can be applied to real-world sales data to provide valuable insights and support data-driven decision-making in a retail context.
